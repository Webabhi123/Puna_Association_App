      In today's make in India, slogan and online business activities today our traders are facing competition from all over globe. After implementation of GST, doing business by small traders has become very difficult as the operating cost of doing business is increased and the margins have come down.

      <p>Our electrical market is in the most congested zone and it is hardly 500 meters peripheral to Pasodya Vithoba Temple and our Pune City is one of the fastest growing city and PMRDA is having waste territory more than Mumbal... Also the infra structures projects coming up like Metro, International Airport, Ring Road and Nasik Pune Railway will give ample business opportunity in coming day's.</p>
      <p>As electrical work is always a major part of any infrastructure and development projects</p>
      <p>Bring to your attention on new amendment proposed by government for Banning of unregulated lending Activities (BULA) this draft bill has proposed penalties for individuals and organizations found in violation of its provisions.</p>
      <p>Overall, the Bill's provisions aim to deter individuals and organisations from engaging in unregulated lending activities and to protect borrowers from exploitation. The severity of the penalties reflects the seriousness with which the government views the issue of unregulated lending in India.</p>
